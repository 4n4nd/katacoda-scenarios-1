# Introduction

In this course you will learn how to train a machine learning model on Prometheus metrics to perform time series forecasting and predict anomalies.

We will use a Jupyter notebook to interact with a Prometheus instance which is currently being deployed.

Please give the environment a couple of minutes to set up.
